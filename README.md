## How to train the CircRNA model
You can train the model of 5-fold cross-validation with a very simple way by the command blow:  
*Python JLCRB.py* and make sure the RNA embedding flag is set to circRNA_model. The script of if **name == "main"** calls training process which trains several models of each model type for a circRNA and finds the best set of hyperparameters. The main function then trains the models several times (num_final_runs) and saves the best model.
## How to train the Linear-RNA model
You can also test the linear-RNA model of 5-fold cross-validation, and make sure the RNA embedding flag is set to linRNA2Vec_model and the file path is set to *linRNA-RBP*.
The prediction results will be displayed automatically. If you need to save the results, please specify the path yourself. Thank you and enjoy the tool!
